<a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitativeanalysis.asp" target="_blank">Quantitative analysis (QA)</a> in finance is an approach that emphasizes mathematical and statistical analysis to help determine the value of a financial asset, such as a stock or option. The ultimate goal of financial quantitative analysis is to use quantifiable statistics and metrics to assist investors in making profitable investment decisions. Quantitative analysis is different from qualitative analysis, which looks at factors such as how companies are structured, the makeup of their management teams, and what their strengths and weaknesses are.

The Quantitative Analysis menu is a common menu to three asset classes:

<a href = "https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/crypto/" target="_blank">Crypto</a> <br>
<a href = "https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/forex/" target= "_blank">Forex</a>  <br>
<a href = "https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/stocks/" target = "_blank">Stocks</a> <br>

<h2>How to use the Quantitative Analysis Menu</h2>

Enter the menu, through one of the asset classes listed above, by entering `qa` in the Terminal. The ticker that is loaded before entering the menu will determine the timeframe for the analysis. To alter it, use the `load` function and pick a new `--start` and `--end` for the observation window. The QA functions target a specified column of the data. By default, this is returns. Use the `pick` command to chose a new target column.

The menu is divided into five categories of functions:
  - Statistics
  - Plots
  - Rolling Metrics
  - Risk
  - Other

A summary of exportable statistics is displayed with the command, `summary`. The example here shows $APPL.

A simple line chart for the target column as a time-series is called with the `line` command.

Optional arguments to this command allows the user to draw and annotate on the chart.

Most outputs are equipped with an `--export` flag, allowing the user to save the tables as a CSV, JSON, or XLSX file. The exports can then be imported into other menus like <a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/econometrics/" target="_blank"> Econometrics</a>. Additional information on each specific command is displayed by attaching `-h` to it.
